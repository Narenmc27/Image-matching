# Reverse Image Matching System

## Overview
This project implements a **Reverse Image Matching System** using the D2-Net feature extraction method. The system allows users to input a sample image and search for matches in a pre-existing database of images. It is designed to efficiently handle large datasets and can be expanded to include various categories, such as faces, automobiles, landscapes, and places.

## Objectives
- Develop an efficient and accurate reverse image matching system.
- Implement D2-Net for feature extraction.
- Provide a proof of concept (POC) for face matching.
- Ensure modularity for future expansion to other image categories.

## Features
- Load and preprocess images.
- Extract features using D2-Net.
- Perform image matching to find the closest image in the database.
- Display the query image alongside the closest match.
- Measure and display the time taken for the matching process.

## Directory Structure

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd repo-name/task_7
Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Place your query image in the root directory and rename it to query_image.jpg, or modify the path in query_image.py.
Ensure that your image database is placed in the images/database/ directory.
Run the script:

python query_image.py
The script will display the query image alongside its closest match from the database and print the distance and time taken for the operation.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
scikit-learn
PyTorch (for D2-Net)
